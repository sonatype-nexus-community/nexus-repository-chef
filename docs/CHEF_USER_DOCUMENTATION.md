## Chef Repositories

### Introduction

[Chef](https://www.chef.io/) is a application management format used to help automate and run an organizations 
infrastructure, using Cookbooks, which are effectively recipes for running an application. 

### Proxying The Chef Supermarket

You can set up an Chef proxy repository to access a remote repository location, for example to proxy the stable Cookbooks 
at [the Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/)

To proxy a Chef repository, you simply create a new 'chef (proxy)' as documented in 
[Repository Management](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/configuration/repository-management) in
detail. Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Define URL for 'Remote storage' e.g. [https://supermarket.chef.io/](https://supermarket.chef.io/)
- Select a 'Blob store' for 'Storage'

### Configuring Chef and Knife 

There are relatively few steps for configuring Chef to use Nexus Repository:

You'll need to have Chef installed, and as well install Knife, for interaction with the Supermarket.

NOTE: These instructions are Linux/OS X specific.

Once you have Chef up and running you'll want to run commands similar to the following:

You'll need to create a `knife.rb` file at the following location if it does not exist:

`~/.chef/knife.rb`

In this file you'll need to add:

`knife[:supermarket_site] = 'http://nexushostname:nexusport/repository/chef-proxy-name'`

As well, you will need to run:

`knife configure`

When asked for the chef server URL, please enter the url for your chef supermarket proxy.

Once you've done this, you should be ready to COOK like a CHEF!

### Browsing Chef Repository Packages

You can browse Chef repositories in the user interface inspecting the components and assets and their details, as
described in [Browsing Repositories and Repository Groups](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Browsing+Repositories+and+Repository+Groups).
